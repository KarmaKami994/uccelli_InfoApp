# Ignored Flutter/Dart specific build/generated directories
# By default, Flutter generates files in .dart_tool.
# We explicitly allow gen_l10n to be tracked for CI workaround.
# If you want to exclude ALL generated files again, uncomment this line.
# /.dart_tool/

# For generated localization files:
# We need to explicitly NOT ignore the gen_l10n folder for the CI workaround.
# This ensures that `git add .dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/` actually adds the files.
# Make sure NO OTHER rule above this one implicitly ignores this path.
# If you have specific exclusion rules for `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/` or similar,
# you might need to adjust them to specifically exclude everything EXCEPT gen_l10n.
# Example: If you had `/.dart_tool/flutter_gen/` you'd remove it.
# The `/.dart_tool/` line (commented above) is the most common one.
